**Key Files**: `Hazard.cs`, `Enemy.cs`, `EnemyAI.cs`

## Phase 4: Content & Polish (Week 7-8)

### Milestone 4.1: Level Design
**Goal**: Create engaging levels

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design 3-5 complete levels
- [ ] Implement level progression system

### Milestone 4.2: User Interface
**Goal**: Complete UI system

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create main menu
- [ ] Design in-game HUD (score, lives, etc.)
- [ ] Add settings menu (audio, controls)
- [ ] Implement level selection screen
- [ ] Add game completion screen

**Key Files**: UI Canvas prefabs, `UIManager.cs`

### Milestone 4.3: Audio & Visual Polish
**Goal**: Enhance game feel

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Comprehensive playtesting
- [ ] Fix collision/physics bugs
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Test on different devices/resolutions
- [ ] Balance gameplay difficulty

### Milestone 5.2: Build & Distribution
**Goal**: Prepare for release

**Tasks**:

## Development Tools & Resources

### Essential Unity Features
- **2D Physics**: Rigidbody2D, Collider2D, Physics2D
- **Animation**: Animator Controller, Animation Clips
- **UI System**: Canvas, UI elements
- **Audio**: AudioSource, AudioClip, AudioMixer
- **Scene Management**: SceneManager, AsyncOperation

### Recommended Unity Packages
```json
{
  "com.unity.2d.animation": "Latest",
  "com.unity.2d.pixel-perfect": "Latest", 
  "com.unity.2d.sprite": "Latest",
  "com.unity.2d.tilemap": "Latest",
  "com.unity.inputsystem": "Latest",
  "com.unity.textmeshpro": "Latest"
}
```

### Art Assets Needed
- **Player Character**: Idle, run, jump, fall animations
- **Environment**: Ground tiles, background elements
- **Collectibles**: Coins, gems, power-ups
- **Enemies**: Basic enemy sprites with animations
- **UI Elements**: Buttons, panels, icons
- **Effects**: Particle textures, explosion sprites

### Audio Assets Needed
- **Music**: Background tracks for levels and menus
- **SFX**: Jump, land, collect, damage, enemy defeat
- **Ambient**: Environmental sounds

## Quality Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for public, camelCase for private)
- Comment complex logic and public API methods
- Keep classes focused on single responsibilities
- Use Unity's component system effectively

### Performance Targets
- **Frame Rate**: Consistent 60 FPS on target devices
- **Memory**: < 100MB RAM usage on mobile
- **Load Times**: < 3 seconds between levels
- **Battery**: Minimal battery drain on mobile devices

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] All levels completable without bugs
- [ ] UI responsive on different screen sizes
- [ ] Audio plays correctly without crackling
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended play
- [ ] Consistent performance across target devices

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to planned features for initial release
2. **Physics Bugs**: Test collision detection thoroughly
3. **Performance Issues**: Profile regularly, optimize early
4. **Control Feel**: Iterate on player movement until it feels good
5. **Level Design**: Playtest levels with fresh players

### Backup Plans
- Keep previous working builds
- Implement features in isolated branches
- Have fallback art assets ready
- Plan for simplified features if time runs short

## Success Metrics

### Development Goals
- Complete playable game in 10 weeks
- 3-5 polished levels
- Smooth 60 FPS performance
- Positive playtester feedback

### Learning Objectives
- Master Unity 2D development workflow
- Understand game physics and feel
- Experience complete game development cycle
- Build portfolio-ready project
